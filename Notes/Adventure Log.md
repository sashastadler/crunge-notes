After finding the tavern by scent (thanks to [Cusdakesh](Characters/PCs/Cusdakesh%20Greyskull.md)), got some information from the bartender.

The [Duke Delight](Characters/NPCs/Duke%20Delight.md) tells the group how to get to [Barenziah](Characters/NPCs/Barenziah.md) :
> A space of great sadness 
> A space of triumph and madness 
> A space of wicked trial 
> A space of meetings final

And how to get back to his domain:
> Yell "surprise" and then run in any direction

The group (Cusdakesh, Eugine, Alphonse, Quentin) go through these spaces:

##### A space of great sadness

A dying tree, with 2 guardians. The tree dies and we console the two creatures (big hug), then continue on our way.

##### A space of triumph and madness

A clearing with a queen bee, with several creatures dressed as bees as well. She asked for a bee, so [Eugine](Characters/PCs/Eugine%20Brawnanvil.md) carved a bee for her and [Quentin](Characters/PCs/Quentin%20Thexius.md) animated it. The queen was delighted by this and let us leave.

##### A space of of wicked trial 

A fairground where we had a choice between three trials: strength, wit, and charm. [Cusdakesh](Characters/PCs/Cusdakesh%20Greyskull.md) competed in the trial of strength, which consisted of a simple wrestling match, which he won because he is very great and strong. The group was allowed to leave, but chose to compete in the other trials for fun (for glory or shame). [Eugine](Characters/PCs/Eugine%20Brawnanvil.md) attempted and lost the trial of wits, which involved solving riddles. [Alphonse](Characters/PCs/Alphonse%20Steele.md) attempted the trial of charm - a breath holding contest disguised as a kissing contest.

##### A space of meetings final

An area of the woods with a large tree, guarded by 2 smaller tree beings, warning that anyone who gets too close gets killed, strengthening the tree. The crew convinces the two to fight the tree they guard and the group of 6 fights the large tree, eventually winning and being allowed to continue to find [Barenziah](Characters/NPCs/Barenziah.md).

The crew finds themselves in Barenziah's house (?), facing wooden copies of themselves, about to fight.

The crew (excluding [Eldrid](Characters/PCs/Eldrid%20Vannar.md) and [Eugine](Characters/PCs/Eugine%20Brawnanvil.md)) sleep over at Nell's and Sextus' place, where [Alphonse](Characters/PCs/Alphonse%20Steele.md) and [Cusdakesh](Characters/PCs/Cusdakesh%20Greyskull.md) start hatching a plan to set up [Quentin](Characters/PCs/Quentin%20Thexius.md) with Nells.

1-Akhet 28: Made it to the tower. Tower looks pretty much the same as before. There are tracks nearby near a trench made by the beast fought previously, so the group chooses to follow them quickly. Tracks end in the middle of the woods, where an old road begins. It's getting late, so the group camps there for the night.

1-Akhet 29: Quentin cooks breakfast (sausage in a bun with mayo). The groups finds a frog-like demon creature guarding a large doorway in a mountian. After distracting it with rocks and a fake deer, the group goes through the doorway into the mountain. Inside, it is dark, but they see much of the cavern used to have wall and pillar art/drawings/words/markings (?) that have been purposefully erased or ruined. They find tunnels, and decide to proceed through them. O.T.W.M. triggers a trap accidentally, getting hit by some rocks, but is able to avoid major harm by dodging out of the way at the last second. After finding and avoiding more traps, the group chooses to go further down through the tunnels.
