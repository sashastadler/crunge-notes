During the night, [Jerry](Characters/NPCs/Jerry.md) was acting weird and a mysterious person attacked [Cusdakesh](Characters/PCs/Cusdakesh%20Greyskull.md) and disappeared. Jerry ran off into the woods.
In the morning, continued to the tower, where we found undead Jerry. Jerry exploded and became a spirit whom we fought.
