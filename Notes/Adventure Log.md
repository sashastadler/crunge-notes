Return to [Green Orchard](Locations/Green%20Orchard.md) for more information about [Blythe](Characters/NPCs/Blythe.md). The crew cornered a villager who said he'd been mugged by a bearded dwarf outside a tavern.

After finding the tavern by scent (thanks to [Cusdakesh](Characters/PCs/Cusdakesh%20Greyskull.md)), got some information from the bartender. The mugger was [Singeir](Characters/NPCs/Singeir.md), who was at the tavern with [Quill](Characters/NPCs/Quill.md) and [Durthu](Characters/NPCs/Durthu.md). Almost get into a bar fight, but don't.

The hooligans leave and the crew follows them far out of Green Orchard. Fought them, killed 1, a few ran away. Interrograted Durthu for Blythe's location. Said we should be mad at [Ajax](Characters/NPCs/Ajax.md).
