#### Plot

Cercislass Andross must brave the weird-woods of Sylvania in this truly terrific tale. Hoping for a vacation from his adventures, Cercislass travels to the elven lands in search of great wine. He immediately becomes embroiled in a gang war. 

Surrounded by elvish mercenaries, he is suddenly saved by a female dwarvish warrior, known only as Ironclad. She offers to escort him to Mongro Rg’th’gaka so that he can gain safe passage back to more civilized lands. 

Cercislass agrees, and the two venture through the Sylvania Woods together. The action is more restrained compared to other tales of Cercislass Andross, with Ironclad taking an uncommonly prominent role in the proceedings. 

The two have obvious feelings for each other, and share a kiss on their last night of travel, but Ironclad then reveals that she is married. Cercislass asks her to leave with him, but she tells him she cannot, as she must care for her child. 

He asks if he will ever see her again; she gives him one of her handaxes and tells him to return it when he has made something of himself. Before they part for the last time, she confides in him her name: Iris. The novel ends with Cercislass looking back at the pillars of Mongro Rg’th’gaka. 

There is a postscript, in which Kairi Edelsson announces an indefinite hiatus.
