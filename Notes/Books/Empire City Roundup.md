#### Plot

This gripping tale sees the powerful and charming adventurer, Cercislass Andross, embarking on an adventure in Tartaros. Our eponymous adventurer hears tell of a rough-and-tumble gang running dirty drugs out of a secret location. He arrives in Empire City, and quickly deduces the source of the drugs: the Penitent of Ironâ€™s temple. 

Upon investigating, a strange metal man attacks him. Cercislass defeats him easily in hand-to-hand combat. The metal man, Dodun, begs to learn from him, and Cercislass allows him to join; for the rest of the novel, Dodun plays the role of sidekick/comedic relief.
