#### Plot

This gripping tale sees the powerful and charming adventurer, Cercislass Andross, embarking on an adventure in Tartaros. Our eponymous adventurer hears tell of a rough-and-tumble gang running dirty drugs out of a secret location. He arrives in Empire City, and quickly deduces the source of the drugs: the Penitent of Iron’s temple. 

Upon investigating, a strange metal man attacks him. Cercislass defeats him easily in hand-to-hand combat. The metal man, Dodun, begs to learn from him, and Cercislass allows him to join; for the rest of the novel, Dodun plays the role of sidekick/comedic relief.

Cercislass battles through the eleven floors of the temple’s Tower of Evil, defeating the drug gang handily with his unarmed combat prowess. The remaining priests thank him for saving them, and he departs -- parting ways with Dodun as the latter embarks on his quest to "become a real boy".
