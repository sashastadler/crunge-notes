#### Plot

This enriching narrative puts the radiant Cercislass Andross in yet another sticky situation: rebellion. Venturing to the frozen north of Geatlond, he falls afoul of the tyrannical local government and is promptly thrown in jail. However, he escapes by wooing the female jailer. He then enters the local resistance.

Unfortunately, he discovers that all resistance efforts are being smothered by a band of Empire patsys: two women, Drusilla and Belle, and two men, Sexist and Kevin. With typical quick thinking, Andross challenges the band during a local music festival. 

His showstopping performance runs Sexist and Kevin out of town, while wooing Drusilla and Belle. The three perform a rebel anthem that empowers the townsfolk to overturn their government. In the morning, Drusilla and Belle wake to find Cercislass gone -- chasing yet another adventure! (edited)
