#### Plot

This swashbuckling tale of love on the waters is the latest electrifying tale of Cercislas Andross. Always looking for a new adventure, he signs on to deliver a shipment of rare golden jewels to Losab Island.

Despite his inexperience, his winning charm and rakish audacity let him commandeer the ship, its previous captains (Aella, a fiery fire genasi, and Drukha, a gorgeous orc) becoming his first mates… although all three could, perhaps, be more. Throughout the journey, his ship is menaced by a notorious pirate seeking to steal the shipment. Just before reaching Losab, Cercislas is ambushed by the pirate - Captain Blackskull.

He proves unable to overcome Cersislas, and flees in a cowardly panic, but not before he fatally wounds Aella. In righteous anger, Cersislas fires a million-to-one cannon shot, igniting the pirate ship’s gunpower reserves and sinking Blackskull forever. He and a broken-hearted Drukha complete the delivery, but rather than take on another contract and sail again with the gorgeous, beautiful, large-breasted orc (who is deeply enamored with him) Cersislas sets off on the road, looking for a new adventure.
