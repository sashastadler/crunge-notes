#### Plot

This rare entry into the canon of Cercislass Andross sees a reused setting, taking place in Gabriol. Andross is warned of a town beset by a mysterious woman: a tiefling witch-queen of immense power who has bewitched a helpless town. 

He goes to investigate, and finds the so-called witch-queen: a priestess of Wotan, god of eyes. He quickly bonds with her, and she confides in him that she faces a trial: she must climb the great mountain and speak to Wotan. Cercislass insists on accompanying her, telling her she stands no hope of reaching the peak alone. 

On the ascent, the two grow closer. Sadly, the priestess collapses before reaching the top, so Andross must carry her. Wotan tells them the trial was truly for Cercislass all along, and grants him a boon of perfect eyesight. 

Cercislass then takes the priestess back home, where she promises to name her son after him if she ever has one; Cercislass instead insists she name him after Cercislassâ€™ own father, Eldridge. 

The book ends with a postscript urging the reader to purchase the next book, A Short Adventure. There is an engraved image of a human adventurer standing next to a dwarf, both looking out from a ridge over a wide woodland.
