##### Outfit

- A thigh-length satin robe, black on one half, white on the other. Gold brocade is stitched along the hem and cuffs, into cloudlike patterns along its surface, and in an intricate chain down the back that separates the white and black halves. The sleeves widen from the elbows, opening to more than twice their original size by the wrists. The robe is tied with a matching gold sash. (purchased from [Ligne Argentée](../../Locations/Siege%20Richesse.md#Ligne%20Argentée) )
- A pair of dark brown leather boots with inch-and-a-half heels. They reach up to the thigh. When the leg is fully extended, they appear normal. With the knee fully bent, the leather appears to split, revealing a dark red eye on the side of each boot and a mouth along the arch. (purchased from [Ligne Argentée](../../Locations/Siege%20Richesse.md#Ligne%20Argentée) )
