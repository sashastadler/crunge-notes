##### Outfit

An ochre and umber kilt. Thick but breathable wool. A deceptive amount of give, so if the wearer spins around it flares dramatically. A light yellow silk shirt. Only buttons halfway up the chest. Flowy sleeves. A dark red, almost brown leather jacket. Rawhide with fringe across the shoulders and hem. A thick brown belt with a buckle bearing an iron symbol of Bondye the Forge-God. A cherry red bolo tie set with a cut carnelian. A pair of calf-length brown boots with half-inch heels. The sides and toe are embroidered in a derby style.

(Full outfit purchased from [Ligne Argentée](../../Locations/Siege%20Richesse.md#Ligne%20Argentée) )
