##### Motto

Nothing is too small to be important. That includes people. 

##### Beliefs
??? 
##### Goals
Help people whenever you see them in need. If someone has too much, help them have less. Protect the weak. Donâ€™t use magic -- unless you need to, of course. Keep other witches on the straight and narrow. Stamp out things that should not be. (edited)
