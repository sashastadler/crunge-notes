### Information

Ananse is a trickster-god of storytelling, lies, and webs woven for purposes both good and bad. His followers are often those who cheat and deceive, but those with harmful intentions soon enough find themselves on the wrong ends of his tricks. Those who remain in his service are invariably wise, with a good sense of humor about themselves and a tempered attitude to mischief. Beware, though -- no matter what they say, a trickster is always a trickster.

 Ananse usually appears as some form of spider. As a human, he is lean and wild-haired, with some number of extra limbs.
