### Information

Baron Criminel is one of the brother-baron gods, or perhaps one face of a single god. Legend says that he was the first to kill another, and so forevermore he is the god of murder. He rules over violence and madness, inspiring deeds of vast cruelty in his followers and empowering them to carry them out.

 Baron Criminel never appears on his own in the material plane, but often possesses his worshippers as part of ritual celebrations. To his followers, he appears sometimes as an illusion: a tall, gaunt man whose face is painted to look like (or, perhaps, is) a bloodied skull.
