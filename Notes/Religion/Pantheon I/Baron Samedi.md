### Information

Baron Samedi is one of the brother-baron gods, or perhaps one face of a single god. He rules over death, and so by extension life: if someone does not die, after all, they must be alive. His blessings extend to both hastening death and extending life, and to dancing on the line between.

 Baron Samedi never appears on his own in the material plane, but often possesses his worshippers as part of ritual celebrations. To his followers, he appears sometimes as an illusion: a tall, gaunt man whose face is painted to look like (or, perhaps, is) a white skull.
