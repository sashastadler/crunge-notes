### Information

Bear is one of the three sibling-deities that hunt Rabbit. His preferred tactics are brute-force assaults. He grants the same strength to his worshippers. All too often, however, they find just as he does that brains can indeed beat brawn.

 Bear usually appears as a bear. As a human, he is stout and armored.
