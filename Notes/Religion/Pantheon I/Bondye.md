### Information

The All-Creator. The pantheon of Black Gods, the deities of the Banyin Confederacy, is loosely defined, with different regions worshipping gods by different names or different versions of them altogether. Everyone, however, worships Bondye. The mother and father of all, every prayer offered to the pantheon of Black Gods is ultimately a prayer to them.

 Due to their immensity, Bondye spans many domains. Their clerics and paladins focus on just one of these, venerating aspects of the greater deity that they can more easily draw on.

 Bondye always appears as a human. Like all the Black Gods, their human form is dark-skinned. Besides this constant, Bondyeâ€™s form is never the same twice.
