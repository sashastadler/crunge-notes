### Information

Fox is one of the three sibling-deities that hunt [Rabbit](Rabbit.md). Her preferred tactics are traps of logic, designed to twist even Rabbit’s mind against her. Followers of Fox employ the same tactics to devastating effect -- but, like Fox herself, often discover that overconfidence is their greatest foe.

 Fox usually appears as a fox. As a human, she is skinny and unkempt.
