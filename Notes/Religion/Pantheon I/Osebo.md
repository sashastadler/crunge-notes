### Information

Osebo is a hungry goddess. Once the second-highest deity in the pantheon, she fell in favor when Ananse tricked her into relinquishing control of her stories. Now all she has is her might -- but it is terrible indeed. The followers of Osebo are all too often cruel and destructive for destruction’s own sake.

Osebo usually appears as a leopard. As a human, she is muscular and befanged, with pale spots across her skin.
