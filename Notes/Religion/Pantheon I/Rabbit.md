### Information

Rabbit is a goddess of life  -- her life. Hers is the domain of the heated chase and the narrow escape. Sometimes worshipped as a goddess of trickery, most now pay homage to her as the spirit of victory against long odds, and as a core part of nature from within rather than above. She offers her followers the unbounded joy of victory and life twinned together, and condemns their foes to a thorny fate.

 Rabbit usually appears as a rabbit or hare. As a human, she is wiry and wide-eyed, with buck teeth.
