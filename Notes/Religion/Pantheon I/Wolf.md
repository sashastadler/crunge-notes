### Information

Wolf is one of the three sibling-deities that hunt [Rabbit](Rabbit.md). Their preferred tactics are relentless, unending pursuit. Just as Rabbit represents life, Wolf represents death -- and death always wins in the end. This is the power their worshippers receive. Wolf, though, can never truly win, for even when they catch Rabbit, their victory lasts only til dawn when she arises once again. Thus, in their eternal chase, the cycle turns.

 Wolf usually appears as a wolf. As a human, they are lean and dangerous.
