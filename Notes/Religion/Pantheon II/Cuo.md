### Information

Cuo is a curious thing. Some debate if it is even a god at all, but enough believe to grant it some amount of power. It speaks freely to its worshippers, promising power if they fulfill its prophecies -- but they never manage to do so. Its other chief pursuit is control. Control of thought, of knowledge, even of life and death -- all are but fodder for Cuoâ€™s aims.
