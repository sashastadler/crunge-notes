### Information

Impera is an aged goddess. Her relevance, once world-shaking, has waned. She still holds sway over the giving and taking of life, but she no longer commands the legions of followers in opulent temples she once did. However, particularly devoted worshippers are sure to hear Imperaâ€™s laughter and her cold hand on their shoulder if they toss a pittance of their gold into the sea for blessing.
