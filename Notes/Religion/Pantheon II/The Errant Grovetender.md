### Information

The Grovetender is a hearth-goddess, of sorts. In her name, sanctuaries are erected, gardens planted, forests defended, homes safeguarded. Her favor may wane temporarily, but it always surges back greater than before in time.

Legends tell of her tragedy and loss, and of the immense power she wielded after to ensure no one would ever again experience such pain. Such legends may never be proven true or false, but the Grovetenderâ€™s powers are undoubtedly greater and stranger than many hearth deities.
