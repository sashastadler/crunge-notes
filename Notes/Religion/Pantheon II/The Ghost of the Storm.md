### Information

The Ghost is the god of chaos. When gale winds blows down the enemy’s fortifications or a clever trick distracts a mad king long enough for a blade to plunge into his chest, it is the Ghost’s domain. His is power, but so too is subtlety: one never knows what tricks will blow in on the Ghost’s winds.

Despite this, the worship of the Ghost characterizes him not as blustering or sinister, but gentle and kind. The temples core to his worship emphasize his forgiving and easy nature. Some of his followers seek to emulate this; others are as variable and overpowering as his domain implies.
