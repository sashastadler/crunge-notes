### Information

The Penitent’s domain is the machinery and methods of destruction. In his name, swords are smithed and swung, and his faithful followers are granted abilities far beyond those of mere mortals. His burning gaze is said to have ignited the first of man’s forges in the dawn of civilization.

Like all the Ancients Ascendant, the Penitent is said to have once been mortal. His origin, however, is the most disputed. Some say he was one of war’s great champions, granted mastery of it for his deeds. Others say he was a victim, now cursed to preside over the cycle of violence. Even his most devoted acolytes are unsure, for on the rare occasions he speaks to his followers, his words are masked with the utmost calm.
