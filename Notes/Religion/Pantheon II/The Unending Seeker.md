### Information

The Seeker is a strange and frightful goddess. Her acolytes wield the powers of scourging radiance and unbending intellect, burning away injustice and ignorance alike. While her domain is indisputably good, it is also overwhelming. Brilliance is often burdensome to those around you.

The most meddlesome of the Ancients Ascendant, the Seeker is said to speak directly to her more powerful followers, even sometimes incarnating to monitor their actions. Her words are often cryptic, however, and some have even called them maddening -- although her worshippers would insist this is only the perception of the unenlightened.
