### Information

Bella is the Misery of War. She was the general who led the rebels in battle. According to doctrine, she was to be executed with her honor guard. However, she pleaded to the court that their obedience to her was a sign of supreme loyalty, not treason. To prove it, [The Lawbreaker](The%20Lawbreaker.md) asked that she command them to carry out her execution. She did so, and died on their blades without so much as a cry of pain.
