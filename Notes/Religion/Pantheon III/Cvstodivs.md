### Information

Cvstodivs, also known as the Ever-Wounded, the Sufferer, and Misery Incarnate, is the core deity of the Westrogoth Empire’s Divine Wheel. Considered holy beyond even veneration, only the highest priests are allowed to offer prayers directly to Cvstodivs. Lesser beings, such as the Empire’s subjects, must instead proceed through one of the eight Miseries, or a similar intercessor.

 In life, Cvstodivs rose centuries ago against the Empire as a rebel, seeking change to an unjust system. His rebellion was quashed, but his image remained: along with his conspirators, he was elevated to a position of godhood, their bodies transformed into reliquaries and their souls into divinity.
