### Information

Dola is the Misery of Trickery. She attempted to hide the rebels in the aftermath of their failed coup. According to doctrine, she was brought before [The Lawbreaker](The%20Lawbreaker.md) and twice given the chance to confess their locations. Both times she refused. Then the Lawbreaker removed his mask, breaking court law to look upon her eye to eye. She wept, and gave up the traitors at once.
