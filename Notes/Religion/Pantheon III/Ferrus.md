### Information

Ferrus is the Misery of Forge. He armed the rebels before their assault on the capital. According to doctrine, his identity was unknown, and immediately after the rebellion he was merely one of a dozen smiths under investigation. However, when questioned, he pridefully claimed the swords recovered from the rebellion as his handiwork. He insisted the blades were his, and that they would cut through anything the Lawbreaker cared to test. The Lawbreaker chose his neck.
