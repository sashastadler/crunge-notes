### Information

Floris is the Misery of Nature. He was the Imperial Gardener, and left the gate open to the High Palace for the rebelsâ€™ assault. According to doctrine, he initially claimed innocence, but confessed on hearing of [Cvstodivs'](Cvstodivs.md) execution. He was beheaded for his act of treason. From the blood that spilled then, a patch of flowers bloomed that still decorate the Imperial Gardens.
