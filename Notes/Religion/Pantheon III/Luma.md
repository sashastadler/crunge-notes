### Information

Luma is the Misery of Light. Her crime was the least of all the rebels: she painted a portrait of [Cvstodivs](Cvstodivs.md), which was used without her knowledge to champion the rebel agenda. According to doctrine, the Lawbreaker showed great mercy to her. Recognizing her ignorance of the crime, he allowed her to live while the rest of the rebels died. Her punishment was slight: to reflect her part in showing the face of rebellion to the masses, the Lawbreaker merely took her eyes. Despite this mercy, she passed soon after.
