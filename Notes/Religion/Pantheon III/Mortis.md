### Information

Mortis is the Misery of Death. Afflicted with a fatal illness, he joined [Cvstodivs](Cvstodivs.md) out of sheer desperation. As time went on, however, he found that the rebel leaderâ€™s presence somehow staved off the progression of his disease. In time, he became the most loyal warrior of the rebellion. According to doctrine, after his capture, Mortis was judged to be unworthy of death. Instead, he was sealed, still living, within an iron coffin. Some would call this a death sentence, but those who have stood within the Hall of Miseries say that if you stand close enough, you can still hear his heart beating so many centuries later.
