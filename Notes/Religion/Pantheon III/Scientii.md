### Information

Scientii is the Misery of Knowledge. An apprentice printer, he used his masterâ€™s press to copy rebel texts. According to doctrine, he was to be spared, but when he was told his texts were to be burned, he insisted he burn with them. He has the distinction of being the only Misery whose reliquary does not contain some preserved element of flesh.
