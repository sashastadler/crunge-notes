### Information

The Lawbreaker is not a Misery, but he is core to the religion of the Empire. If [Cvstodivs](Cvstodivs.md) is the center of the Divine Wheel and his Miseries are the Spokes, the Lawbreaker is the rim into which all are set. While the Miseries have their domains, the Lawbreaker’s is justice and safety itself. Since the time of the rebellion, many men have inhabited the office: but every one is venerated just the same, elevated by his position to the stature of a living god.

Due to certain peculiarities of the Empire’s language, the title “Lawbreaker” does not translate fully. The implication of unlawfulness is quite incorrect. In the original, the title means something much different. A perfect translation is impossible… but it could be rendered more or less faithfully as “One who uses the law to break.”
