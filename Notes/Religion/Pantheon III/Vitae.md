### Information

Vitae is the Misery of Life. She served as the healer of the rebels. According to doctrine, she was sentenced to three decadesâ€™ labor as a military healer in recompense for her crimes so that she might give life anew. However, the night before her punishment was to begin, she prayed to [Cvstodivs](Cvstodivs.md) and died peacefully in her cell. So that her gifts would not be wasted, she was elevated to the station of Misery, and now gives life still.
