### Information

Like all his kin, Odin is a forgotten god. His worship was once common in the Norlands, but the Banyin Confederacyâ€™s Black Gods all but supplanted his pantheon when they came to power.

 Odin is known to be a wise god, as well as a deeply powerful one. Many stories tell of his death, which must mean he is deeply linked to life to keep returning so many times. Worshippers of Odin also often tell of strange, prophetic dreams.
