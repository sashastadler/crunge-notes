### Information

Along with [Odin](Odin.md), Zeus is frequently referred to in the writings of the Forgotten as a leader and king. Attempts to reconcile the two as well as some controversial suggestions that they must belong to differing pantheons have given way to a common understanding that they were most likely husband-gods. 

 Zeusâ€™ power clearly manifests in thunder and lightning, but the many references to children of Zeus in the remaining writings suggest he was also likely a fertility god.
